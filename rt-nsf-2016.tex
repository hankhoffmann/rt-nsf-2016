\noindent{\bf XPS: FULL: CCA: Collaborative Research: CASH: Cost-aware Adaptation of Software and Hardware} (CCF 1439156, PI: Hoffmann, 09/2014-08/2018, \$300,000)\\
\noindent{\bf EAGER: HAWKEYE}: A Cross-Layer Resilient Architecture to Tradeoff Program Accuracy and Resilience Overheads <HANK: Fill in details>\\
\noindent{\bf CNS: SMALL: BreezeFS} \\
\noindent{\bf II-New: RIVER: A Research Infrastructure to Explore Volatility, Energy-Efficiency, and Resilience} (CNS 1405959, PI: Chien, Co-PIs: Foster, Gunawi, Hoffmann, Scott, 07/2014-07/2017, \$997,432) 

All projects advance the study of adaptive computing systems.  CASH
studies the modeling and allocation of fine-grain hardware structures
to produce cost savings in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) clouds.
HAWKEYE studies the ability to dynamically trade program accuracy for
error detection overhead.  BreezeFS studies adaptive management of
multi-store systems for clouds.  Among other things, RIVER's
infrastructure supports study of large-scale adaptation to meet power
and performance goals in distributed computing systems.  Both projects
began less than 6 months ago.

\noindent {\em Intellectual Merit:} In the CASH project we have
developed novel hardware structures for performance monitoring as well
as novel combinations of machine learning and control theory for
allocating fine-grain hardware resources and minimizing costs.  Both
HAWKEYE and BreezeFS are in their early stages, but both will study
application of adaptive tradeoff management to new problems
(resilience and storage management, respectivel).  

% --------------
\noindent {\em Broader Impact:} The CASH project has already resulted
in four pulbished papers from the University of Chicago
\cite{cpsna,POET,FSE2015,JouleGuard} and one submitted publication
whose outcome is still pending as of this writing.

\Large{\textbf{\\Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{General computing environment.} The Department of Computer Science hosts more than 40 research labs with access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; 2 open labs for graduate students; and a 128-seat open access lab for undergraduate students. These labs consist of over 500 state-of-the-art, high-performance workstations and high-end PCs, all connected via gigabit Ethernet switches with a redundant fiber up-link to provide fast access to the campus network and the Internet. Nine classrooms and one large lecture hall with the latest computer and audio-visual equipment are available. Academic coursework, project, and computing systems are comprised of Linux x86\_64, Windows Server, and Solaris 10 executing on a collection of physical servers and virtual server private clouds. The servers are connected via fiber channel and iSCSI to a thin-provisioned 14TB 3PAR mesh-active storage array. 

\paragraph{Specific computing facilities.} Computer Science Open Access Lab: This lab is accessible to all students currently enrolled in any course in the department of computer science (128 seats). The lab consists of 128 Dell OptiPlex 980 machines with i7-870 Processor (8M Cache, 2.93 GHz), 4GB RAM, 22'' (Dell P2210) flat-panel display, Windows 7, 64-bit; Two HP Laserjet 9040 printers are also located in the lab. The lab is open from 8am to 11pm, M-F, and 11pm-7pm Sat/Sun. The Lab is maintained by the CS Tech Staff. A monitor (typically a graduate student hired half-time) is on premises all the time.

Graduate Windows Lab: This 15 seat lab is accessible to all graduate students.  Equipment consists of Dell Precision T1650 computers with Intel XEON CPU E3 1225 v2, @3.20GHz, 8GB RAM, 24'' flat-panel monitors, Windows 7 Enterprise and an HP Laserjet P4015n printer. The lab is accessible 24/7 with smart card access.

Project Design Lab: This 20 seat lab is accessible to all CS undergraduate/graduate students who take senior design project class. It consists of  Dell Optiplex 760 machines with Intel Core2 Duo, E8400@3.00GHz, 2GB RAM, 17''flat-panel monitors, Windows 7 Enterprise. The lab is accessible 24/7 with smart card access.

General Access Systems: The Department also maintains several systems in its server room to which remote access is provided. These include the Network Programming System that are ccessible to all CS students enrolled in network programming and parallel processing courses (45 systems); Students access these systems via SSH; All these 45 systems run Linux CentOS 6.2 x86\_64. The Department also maintains two large Linux compute servers (Linux CentOS 6.2 x86\_64, Dell PowerEdge R710 w/2 six-core 2.53GHz Intel Xeon, 32GB RAM) and two large Solaris computer servers (Sun Fire V440 w/4x1GHz UltraSPARC-IIIi, 8GB RAM). 

Server clouds: The Department also maintains a general purpose server cloud, a VMware vSphere 4 operating on 5 ESX hosts with dual 6-core processor 128GB RAM servers, used for teaching the cloud computing related courses as well as a network security courses server cloud,  a VMware vSphere 4 executing on 4 processors of 6-core Opterons, 128GB RAM, and four 4Gb redundant fiber channel SAN connections.

In addition to the above labs and facilities, CS students also have access the UTDesign Studio that is equipped with modern computing facilities and equipment with more than 30,000 square feet of dedicated space, where students and corporate partners can create, innovate, design, build and learn. Further information can be found at $http://www.utdallas.edu/utdesign/corporate/studio/$. The UTDesign studio is primarily used by undergraduate seniors taking the capstone project course.

A 30' x 20' lab is available for Dr. Liu's students. The lab can comfortably accommodate 8 students and the computing equipment. Eight workstations equipped with state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs currently in the PI's lab will be available to the project.

\Large{\textbf{\\Data Management Plan}}
\end{center}

This data management plan covers all of the data products to be produced in this project. It includes all source code that implements the ecosystem of GPU resource management, any source code added to LITMUS$^{\textrm{RT}}$,  the suite of case-study programs, and scripts used to test and evaluate the implementation of the proposed components, along with the data collected during evaluation efforts. 

\paragraph{Source code.} All source code will be freely available for direct download from public web servers maintained by the UTD Computer Science Department under an open source GPL license.  Additional case-study test programs and scripts will be freely available under the open source BSD license and directly downloadable from public web servers maintained by the UTD Computer Science Department. Our intend in making these data products freely available is that other researchers can verify evaluation results, and relevant research conducted by other interested groups can be facilitated.

\paragraph{Evaluation data.} Evaluation data (including raw data and resulting graphs) can be several terabytes in size. It is thus currently not feasible to make this data available to the public through direct download. We will store and back up such data on secured servers maintained by the UT-Dallas Computer Science Department. Interested parties may request copies of this data through making arrangement for private direct download or using the postal system.

\paragraph{Privacy.} No personal data will be acquired in this project. There are no privacy concerns for the storage of data.

\paragraph{Long-term storage.} All data products produced in this project will also be archived in the UTD computer science computing repository for permanent storage.
