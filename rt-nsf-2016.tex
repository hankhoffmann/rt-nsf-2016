\Large{\textbf{Project Summary}}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Summary}
The physical constraints of thermal and power dissipation have led to
the emergence of \emph{dark silicon} in embedded processor designs.
Dark silicon refers to the fact that not all transistors can be
powered at full speed all the time --- doing so would destroy the chip
--- so some set of transistors must be kept dark --- unpowered.  To
address this issue, embedded processor designers have turned to
heterogeneous processor designs which combine powerful, but energy
inefficient cores, with slow, but energy efficient ones.

The combination of dark silicon and heterogeneous processor designs
creates both a challenge and an opportunity for embedded systems
designers and embedded operating systems in particular.  Embedded
operating systems must support hard real-time requirements and work to
reduce energy consumption.  The challenge of heterogeneous designs is
that real-time schedulers must now incorporate knowledge of differing
core types and reason about the diverse design space of scheduling
options that arise from multiple core types on the same chip.  The
opportunity is that dark silicon effectively creates a ``reserve'' of
additional computing power that can be brought to bear in short bursts
(but is not sustainable without damaging the hardware).  

\emph{This proposal's goal is to create new real-time scheduling
  algorithms for embedded systems that both address the challenge and
  exploit the opportunity of heterogeneous processor designs and dark
  silicon.}


\paragraph{Intellectual Merit} 
We seek to develop new real-time scheduling algorithms for
heterogeneous multicores that (1) are more energy efficient than the
current state-of-the-art and (2) can provide a new capability:
guaranteeing both timing and energy consumption for embedded
workloads.  While prior work has addressed real-time support on
heterogeneous architectures, it has primarily focused on porting
existing techniques developed for homogeneous systems and ensuring
that they can still meet hard real-time guarantees.  When ported to
heterogeneous systems, existing techniques are more energy efficient,
but this gain is entirely due to the processor architecture and not an
inherent feature of the algorithm.  The key insight in our proposed
work will be to start from scratch and incorporate knowledge of
heterogeneity and energy into our proposed algorithms from the
beginning of the project.  This approach promises to lead to new
algorithms that have better energy efficiency and offer new
capabilities.

We plan to evaluate these algorithms both analytically and
empirically.  Our empirical test case will be automotive computing, a
rich embedded processing domain that includes safety critical tasks,
like collision detection, and best effort tasks like infotainment.  We
will test the energy savings and schedulability of our algorithms by
implementing them for an state-of-the-art ARM big.LITTLE heterogeneous
embedded multicore and using them to schedule a representative
automotive workload.  We will demonstrate the proposed algorithms'
energy efficiency and ability to increase schedulability for the
automotive workload on real heterogeneous processors.

\paragraph{Broader Impacts}
The proposed research agenda provides for significant broader impacts
related to (1) curriculum development and student training through
integration of modules in existing real-time, energy-aware, and system
design courses, and (2) outreach through established enrichment
programs at the participating universities. The proposed research
benefits society by directly addressing the needs of smart
cyberphysical systems such as self-driving cars, embedded medical
devices, and intelligent robotics.  Such systems play critical roles
in manufacturing, defense, and healthcare. The proposed research
benefits cyberphysical systems by (1) enabling greater functionality
and new capabilities for the same cost and (2) greatly reducing system
energy consumption, perhaps leading to medical devices that last
longer or systems that need to be replaced less often.

\Large{\textbf{\\Data Management Plan}}
\end{center}

This data management plan covers all of the data products to be produced in this project. It includes all source code that implements the energy-efficient real-time resource allocation algorithms, any source code added to LITMUS$^{\textrm{RT}}$,  the suite of case-study programs, and scripts used to test and evaluate the implementation of the proposed components, along with the data collected during evaluation efforts. 

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent \textbf{Source code.} All source code will be freely available for direct download from public web servers maintained by the University of Texas at Dallas Computer Science Department under an open source GPL license.  Additional case-study test programs and scripts will be freely available under the open source BSD license and directly downloadable from public web servers maintained by the UTD Computer Science Department. Our intend in making these data products freely available is that other researchers can verify evaluation results, and relevant research conducted by other interested groups can be facilitated.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent \textbf{Evaluation data.} Evaluation data (including raw data and resulting graphs) can be several terabytes in size. It is thus currently not feasible to make this data available to the public through direct download. We will store and back up such data on secured servers maintained by the University of Texas at Dallas Computer Science Department. Interested parties may request copies of this data through making arrangement for private direct download or using the postal system.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent \textbf{Data Format and Metadata Standards: } We intend to share the measurement/trace data using comma-separated values (CSV) format, which is a set of file formats used to store tabular data in which numbers and text are stored in a plain-text form that can be easily written and read in a text editor.  It is very easy for others to convert this format into more advanced data format at user's discretion.  We will provide readme files to explain the data format and contextual details (metadata and instructions) for understanding and processing these data files. Source code and simulation programs will be stored in their respective native
formats, for example ��.m�� for Matlab code, ��.c/cpp�� for C/C++ code. Simulation and experimental results
will be stored in ��.dat�� or ��.fig�� formats. Project reports, conference, and journal papers will be in either
Microsoft Word (��.doc�� or ��.docx��) format, or Latex format.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent \textbf{Data Sharing, Distribution and Preservation Plan: }
We plan to make publicly available the electronic raw trace data produced under this project as well as the associated metadata that describes the
experimental setup, modeling methodology and data analysis methods. We also plan to make publicly
available the analyzed data in the forms of peer-reviewed conference, journal articles, thesis, and book
chapters. The electronic data will be preserved in multiple on-site RAID hard drive storages at the
University of Texas at Dallas and  and University of Minnesota.
The data will be shared through the web server provided by the University of Texas at Dallas or through direct
contact with the PIs. Data will be available for access and sharing as soon as the proposed research has
been accomplished, or no more than two years after the acquisition of the data. 
We will also share our tools and publications with the CPS research community through the CPS Virtual Organization (VO). The data will be preserved for at least three years beyond the award period, as required by NSF guidelines. Since the data format we
choose is CVS, which can be easily edited and converted, we expect no problem to archive and transform
our electronic trace data in the foreseeable future after the project has been completed. All data products produced in this project will also be archived in the UTD computer science computing repository for permanent storage.


\vspace{1mm}
\noindent \textbf{Privacy.} No personal data will be acquired in this project. There are no privacy concerns for the storage of data.

\large \noindent\textbf{1 \ \ Regular Communication and Reporting}\normalsize
\vspace{4mm}

\noindent The proposed research activities will be carried out at two different universities: The University of Texas at Dallas and University of Chicago. The entire team will participate in a bi-weekly on-line meeting through free online teleconference services. In addition, as one of the budget line items, one domestic trip per year is arranged for bringing Dr. Hoffman and any of his supported students in this project to the University of Texas at Dallas together. A written progress report on all supported activities will be produced on a quarterly basis.

\vspace{6mm}
\large \noindent\textbf{2 \ \ Team Formation and Specific Roles}\normalsize
\vspace{4mm}

\noindent Our team consists of two experts in the general fields of real-time systems, operating systems, heterogeneous processor design, and power optimization. PI Liu has rich experience in operating systems support for heterogeneous real-time systems~\cite{Liu12, GPES, zhou2015supporting, Zhou2014a} and real-time resource allocation on heterogeneous computing platforms~\cite{Tong14a, LiuRTSS14a, LiuRTSS15, Liu1, Liu2, Liu6, Liu7, Liu10, liu2014supporting, LiuRTSS14b, elliott1minimizing, Liu3, Liu4, Liu5, Liu9, Liu11, Liu13}.
PI Hoffman has rich experience in homogeneous\cite{raw1,raw2,raw3,tilera1,tilera2} and heterogeneneous \cite{ASAP,HPEC,ASAP2,ISSoC} processor design as well as operating systems support for managing performance and power tradeoffs \cite{LEO,POET,DynamicKnobs,JouleGuard,PTRADE,ICAC,TCST,HotPower,CPSNA}.

 In this project, the University of Texas at Dallas will assume a management and coordination role. The University of Texas at Dallas will be responsible for maintaining a central project repository where tools will be integrated and data will be collected. These tools and data will be made available to the community. The specific roles of the project participants in all organizations involved are described as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item Dr. Liu will be responsible for designing, analyzing, and evaluating energy-efficient configurations for heterogeneous platforms that simultaneously guarantee timing correctness.
\item Dr. Hoffman will lead the research on the design and analysis of the techniques to aggressively address energy optimization and guarantees. 
\item The two PIs intend to  work closely together on the implementation and evaluation of the proposed approaches.
\end{itemize}
