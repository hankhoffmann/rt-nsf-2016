\noindent \textbf{Prior NSF Support.} PI Cong Liu  has recently received the following NSF grant:

\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
\item \textit{CSR: Small: Predictable Real-Time Computing in GPU-enabled Systems}, CNS-1527727, 10/15-9/18.
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{itemize}

This proposal addresses the challenge of applying GPUs in
safety-critical systems, which ensures predictable real-time
correctness. This goal will be achieved by (i) establishing GPU-aware
resource allocation methods that yield quantifiable guarantees on
real-time correctness, and (ii) implementing an ecosystem of GPU
resource management that enables GPUs to be predictably utilized in a
real-time multi-tasking environment. This grant will be used to
support two PhD students (including a female student) for three years.

All projects advance the study of adaptive computing systems.  CASH
studies the modeling and allocation of fine-grain hardware structures
to produce cost savings in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) clouds.
BreezeFS studies adaptive management of multi-store systems for
clouds.  Among other things, RIVER's infrastructure supports study of
large-scale adaptation to meet power and performance goals in
distributed computing systems.  

\noindent {\em Intellectual Merit:} In the CASH project we have
developed novel hardware structures for performance monitoring as well
as novel combinations of machine learning and control theory for
allocating fine-grain hardware resources and minimizing costs.
BreezeFS has just begun, but it will study application of adaptive
tradeoff management to storage systems.

\noindent {\em Broader Impact:} The CASH project has already resulted
in four pulbished papers from the University of Chicago
\cite{kim-cpsna,POET,FSE2015,JouleGuard} and one submitted publication
whose outcome is still pending as of this writing.
