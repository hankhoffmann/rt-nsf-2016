Note that throughout the project, we intend to work on algorithmic and schedulability-analysis issues, implementation, and evaluations in parallel.

\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-1mm}
\item \textbf{Year 1:} During Year~1, we will focus on identifying energy-efficient configurations that yields the tightest schedulability tests, as summarized in Sec.~\ref{sec:part1}. In the second half of this year, we will begin  developing more aggressive energy-saving techniques, as summarized in Sec.~\ref{sec:part2}

\item \textbf{Year 2:} During Year~2, we expect to complete all research problems related to the design and analysis of resource allocation methods. We will then begin working on conducting overhead-aware energy and schedulability studies, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:step3}.

\item \textbf{Year 3:} During Year~3, we intend to focus our attention on experimental and case-study evaluations (and  may improve implementation details based on evaluation), as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:step4}.
\end{itemize}

We expect that our research will result in approximately five to eight conference and journal papers per year (based upon our past publication rates).
