In this section, we first describe the heterogeneous computing
architecture and the associated energy and performance characteristics
of such platforms. ARM's big.LITTLE will be used as an example
heterogeneous computing platform we choose to focus in this
document. To ensure timing correctness, real-time resource allocation
techniques must be used. We will thus discuss traditional real-time
scheduling-related terminology and workload models. Finally, we
describe the experimental platform to be used in our research. Due to
space constraints, our overview of prior work focuses on research of
direct relevance to our agenda.
