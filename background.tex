This section motivates the need for the proposed research.  We first
illustrate how the emergence of heterogeneous single-ISA architectures
and dark silicon change timing and energy tradeoffs making previously
useful resource allocation strategies extremely inefficient.  We then
discuss background in real-time scheduling and schedulability.
Finally, we discuss related work scheduling for heterogenous systems.
\emph{Critically, we find that prior work has not...}
