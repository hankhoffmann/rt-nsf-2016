In this section, we first describe the heterogeneous computing architecture and the associated energy and performance characteristics of such platforms. ARM's big.LITTLE will be used as an example heterogeneous computing platform we choose to focus in this document. To ensure timing correctness, real-time resource allocation techniques must be used. We will thus discuss traditional real-time scheduling-related terminology and workload models. Finally, we describe the experimental platform to be used in our research. Due to space constraints, our overview of prior work focuses on research of direct relevance to our agenda.
=======
This section motivates the need for the proposed research.  We first
illustrate how the emergence of heterogeneous single-ISA architectures
and dark silicon change timing and energy tradeoffs making previously
useful resource allocation strategies extremely inefficient.  We then
discuss background in real-time scheduling and schedulability.
Finally, we discuss related work scheduling for heterogenous systems.
\emph{Critically, we find that prior work has not...}
