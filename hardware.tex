 
\subsubsection{Architecture Trends}
Modern computing systems are constrained by \emph{dark silicon};
\emph{i.e.}, not all transistors can be powered at all times
\cite{DaSi2011,Venkatesh2010}.  The emergence of dark silicon has led
hardware architects to rethink processor design.  Recent designs
incorporate differing cores with a common instruction set and
programming model~\cite{Kumar.2005.heterogeneous,SulemanMQP09}.  Some
cores are complex with deep pipelines and large issue width, while
others are much simpler \cite{bigLittle}.  These \emph{heterogeneous
single-ISA} designs improve energy efficiency by executing computation
on the most appropriate type of core.

While these processors present a wide range of performance and energy
tradeoffs, they create a difficult scheduling problem.  Not only, does
a software scheduler have to map tasks to core types, it also most
ensure that energy is minimized (to increase battery life) and that
critical power threshholds are not violated.  For example, the Exynos
5 processor (based on an ARM big.LITTLE architecture \cite{bigLittle})
has a 5.5W peak power that is nearly $2 \times$ the maximum
sustainable heat dissipation, limiting peak speed to less than 1
second \cite{exynos5}.  In addition, our prior work has shown that
this processor achieves greater energy efficiency as it slows down
\cite{Imes2014}.  

Such a processor desing creates both a challenge and an opportunity
for real-time embedded processing. The challenge is how to ensure that
timing constraints are met while operating in the most
energy-efficient configuration.  The opportunity comes from the fact
that the processor is overprovisioned, it has a much higher compute
capacity than it can safely sustain.  This extra compute capacity
could be used in short bursts to prevent timing errors.  The next
section illustrates these concepts with empirical results.

We use an example application to compare the different tradeoffs on a
heterogeneous single-ISA processor and a homogeneous multicore.  As a
target application, we use a video encoder, composed of jobs, where
each job encodes a frame. We instrument the encoder to report job
latency and measure each processor's energy consumption.  The two
processors have different configurable resources, shown in
Table~\ref{tbl:machines}.

\end{figure}

The different shapes of these tradeoff spaces lead to different
optimal resource allocation strategies. Empirical studies show that
the \emph{race~to~idle} heuristic, which makes all resources available
and then idles after completing a job, is near optimal on systems like
the homogeneous
processor~\cite{PowerSlope,Hoelzle2009,google,Imes2014,HotPower}.  On
systems like the heterogeneous processor, recent approaches save
energy by keeping the system constantly busy and
\emph{never~idle}~\cite{Carroll13,LeSueur11,Lin2010,Imes2014,HotPower}.

To demonstrate how different scheduling decisions affect the different
platforms, we compare the energy consumption of both race-to-idle and
never-idle.  We set a latency target equal to the worst observed
latency for this application on each processor and measure the energy
consumption of encoding 500 video frames using each heuristic.
Figure~\ref{x264-motivation-heuristics} shows the results, normalized to
the optimal energy found by measuring every possible resource
configuration for each frame.  Both heuristics meet the latency
target, but their energy consumptions vary tremendously. On the
homogeneous processor, \emph{race~to~idle} is near optimal, but
\emph{never~idle} consumes 13\% more energy.  Conversely,
\emph{never~idle} is near optimal for the heterogeneous processor, but
\emph{race~to~idle} consumes $2 \times$ more energy.

These results demonstrate two key points:
\begin{itemize}
\item The conventional approach of allocating all resources and
transitioning to a low power idle state is extremely inefficient on
the heterogeneous processor.  
\item The heterogeneous processor can
reach speeds of up to XX faster than it can safely sustain.
\end{itemize}
